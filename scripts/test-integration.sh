# If PRAVEGA_CONTROLLER_URI is not set, then Pravega standalone will be started and stopped by the integration test.
# For example: export PRAVEGA_CONTROLLER_URI=127.0.0.1:9090

# If RTSP_URL is set, it will be used for all RTSP tests. This allows for real cameras to be used.
# Otherwise, the integration test will run an in-process RTSP camera simulator that is appropriate for each test.
# See rtsp-env-sample.sh for an example.

# Multiple test threads can be used but troubleshooting is easier with just 1 thread.
# When increasing this, we recommend using a Pravega server started with ../pravega-docker/up.sh
# to better handle the high load.
